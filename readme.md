I'm thinking of using a series of singleton controll classes to make a control class layer that keeps the interface away from the entities.
An abstract factory might be a good approach to creating different types of farms. I'll have to try it before I'll really know. I might also use an abstract facory for different kinds of farmers. (I swear that I typed this before reading the "HINTS" part of the assignment doc :-P.)
